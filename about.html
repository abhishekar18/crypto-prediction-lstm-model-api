            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our website, created an engineering graduate who are passionate about the world of
                cryptocurrency. Our platform offers a unique solution for predicting cryptocurrency prices using LSTM
                Neural Networks. We understand the importance of accurate and reliable predictions in the volatile
                cryptocurrency market. 
                <br><br>
                That's why we have implemented our code in such a way that users can easily enter
                the cryptocurrency coin code and currency code of their choice to get a prediction graph generated by our LSTM
                model.
                <br>
                To further assist users in making informed decisions, we also have a suggestion tab where they
                can fill out a survey to get recommendations on the best coins to invest in.
                <br>
                Additionally, we have provided links for users to gain deeper knowledge in this domain. 
                We hope our website will be a valuable resource for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike.</p>
