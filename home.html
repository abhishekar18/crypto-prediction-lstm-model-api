			<h2>Welcome to our Cryptocurrency Project</h2>
			<p>Welcome to our cryptocurrency project website! We are thrilled to provide you with the latest information
				and insights about the emerging world of digital assets. Cryptocurrencies are changing the way people
				invest their money, and the decentralized nature of this market is a major factor in its growth. Our
				goal is to help you navigate this exciting and complex landscape by providing you with cutting-edge
				research and analysis.
				<br>
				<br>
				In this project, we focus on forecasting bitcoin values using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
				network model. With the help of this model, we can learn long-term dependencies and detect data patterns
				that conventional machine-learning models might miss. Our research aims to provide more accurate
				predictions of bitcoin values, and we hope that our findings will be valuable to both investors and
				researchers.
				<br>
				<br>
				We invite you to explore our website, where you will find detailed information about our research, our
				team, and the latest news and trends in the cryptocurrency market. Thank you for visiting, and we hope
				you find our project informative and engaging.</p>
